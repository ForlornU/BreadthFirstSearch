# BreadthFirstSearch
 
BFS-Style pathfinding for use across hexagonal tiles in the unity3d engine!

I ripped part of the pathfinding code from an old project I had and put it back together in a more coherent form, I'm hoping to explore this further and add different types of pathfinding algorithms later on and present them in small, easy to use versions
